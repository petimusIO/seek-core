# seek-core Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

We've successfully implemented the seek-core module for an AI personalized tutor MVP. The module is a standalone, stateless Python package that can:

1. Take a learner profile as input (age, grade level, learning style, known topics, struggles, and learning goal)
2. Generate a comprehensive learning plan with:
   - A sequence of 3-5 micro-lessons (learning roadmap)
   - A quiz with 3-5 multiple-choice questions
   - A personalized explanation of the target concept
   - Optional resource links for visual learners

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+** as the programming language
- **Pydantic** for data validation and modeling
- **OpenAI API** for generating personalized educational content
- **Pytest** for testing

## Key Components

### Models
- `LearnerProfile`: Represents a student's profile data
- `MicroLesson`: Represents a single learning unit in the roadmap
- `QuizQuestion`: Represents a multiple-choice question
- `LearningPlanResponse`: The complete learning plan response

### Services
- `RoadmapService`: Generates the learning roadmap
- `QuizService`: Creates the quiz questions
- `ExplanationService`: Produces personalized concept explanations
- `LearningPlanService`: Orchestrates the entire process

### LLM Integration
- `LLMService`: Handles communication with OpenAI's API

## Configuration Options

The package can be configured using environment variables or directly in code. Options include:
- OpenAI model selection
- Minimum/maximum number of lessons and questions
- Temperature and token settings
- Logging configuration

## Usage Options

The package provides multiple ways to use it:
1. **Python API**: Import and use in Python code
2. **Command Line Interface**: Use the provided CLI tool
3. **Example Script**: Run the provided example.py for a quick demo

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. Adding analytics to track learning plan effectiveness
2. Implementing caching for similar requests
3. Developing more sophisticated content adaptation based on learning progress
4. Supporting more diverse learning styles and cultural contexts
5. Adding support for different question types beyond multiple-choice
